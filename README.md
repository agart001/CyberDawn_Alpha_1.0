## Description
The project was the Capstone of my associates, It was meant to be a simulation of the development life-cycle and exercise in team work. I believe there were 3 other students including myself on the team, I worked as the lead Programmer/Designer and by the end I was de facto the Project Lead. The game is a 2D metroidvania with cyber punk theme, where the player can battle diverse enemies and unlock different weapons by completing different levels. Considering how inexperienced we all were, we definitely lack the communication skills necessary to form an effective team but in the end most of the deliverables we set in the game design documment were implmented and we all learned what would be expected of us in future team-based projects.
